# Retrieve raster data from STAC endpoints

These functions retrieve raster data from STAC endpoints and optionally
create composite data sets from multiple files. `get_stac_data()` is a
generic function which should be able to download raster data from a
variety of data sources, while the other helper functions have useful
defaults for downloading common data sets from standard STAC sources.

## Arguments

- aoi:

  An sf(c) object outlining the area of interest to get imagery for.
  Will be used to get the bounding box used for calculating metrics and
  the output data's CRS.

- start_date, end_date:

  Character of length 1: The first and last date, respectively, of
  imagery to include in metrics calculations. Should be in YYYY-MM-DD
  format.

- pixel_x_size, pixel_y_size:

  Numeric of length 1: size of pixels in x-direction (longitude /
  easting) and y-direction (latitude / northing).

- asset_names:

  The names of the assets to download. If this vector has names, then
  the names of the vector are assumed to be the names of assets on the
  STAC server, which will be renamed to the elements of the vector in
  the final output.

- stac_source:

  Character of length 1: the STAC URL to download imagery from.

- collection:

  Character of length 1: the STAC collection to download images from.

- ...:

  Passed to `item_filter_function`.

- query_function:

  A function that takes the output from
  [`rstac::stac_search()`](https://brazil-data-cube.github.io/rstac/reference/stac_search.html)
  and executes the request. See
  [`rsi_query_api()`](https://docs.ropensci.org/rsi/reference/rsi_query_api.md)
  and the `query_function` slots of
  [sentinel1_band_mapping](https://docs.ropensci.org/rsi/reference/sentinel1_band_mapping.md),
  [sentinel2_band_mapping](https://docs.ropensci.org/rsi/reference/sentinel2_band_mapping.md),
  and
  [landsat_band_mapping](https://docs.ropensci.org/rsi/reference/landsat_band_mapping.md).

- download_function:

  A function that takes the output from `query_function` and downloads
  the assets attached to those items. See
  [`rsi_download_rasters()`](https://docs.ropensci.org/rsi/reference/rsi_download_rasters.md)
  for an example.

- sign_function:

  A function that takes the output from `query_function` and signs the
  item URLs, if necessary.

- rescale_bands:

  Logical of length 1: If the STAC collection implements the `raster`
  STAC extension, and that extension includes `scale` and `offset`
  values, should this function attempt to automatically rescale the
  downloaded data?

- item_filter_function:

  A function that takes the outputs of `query_function` (usually a
  `STACItemCollection`) and `...` and returns a filtered
  `STACItemCollection`. This is used, for example, to only download
  images from specific Landsat platforms.

- mask_band:

  Character of length 1: The name of the asset in your STAC source to
  use to mask the data. Set to `NULL` to not mask. See the `mask_band`
  slots of
  [sentinel1_band_mapping](https://docs.ropensci.org/rsi/reference/sentinel1_band_mapping.md),
  [sentinel2_band_mapping](https://docs.ropensci.org/rsi/reference/sentinel2_band_mapping.md),
  and
  [landsat_band_mapping](https://docs.ropensci.org/rsi/reference/landsat_band_mapping.md).

- mask_function:

  A function that takes a raster and returns a boolean raster, where
  `TRUE` pixels will be preserved and `FALSE` or `NA` pixels will be
  masked out. See
  [`sentinel2_mask_function()`](https://docs.ropensci.org/rsi/reference/sentinel2_mask_function.md).

- output_filename:

  The filename to write the output raster to. If `composite_function` is
  `NULL`, item datetimes will be appended to this in order to create
  unique filenames. If items do not have datetimes, a sequential ID will
  be appended instead.

- composite_function:

  Character of length 1: The name of a function used to combine
  downloaded images into a single composite (i.e., to aggregate pixel
  values from multiple images into a single value). Options include
  "merge", which 'stamps' images on top of one another such that the
  "last" value downloaded for a pixel – which isn't guaranteed to be the
  most recent one – will be the only value used, or any of "sum",
  "mean", "median", "min", or "max", which consider all values available
  at each pixel. Set to `NULL` to not composite (i.e., to rescale and
  save each individual file independently).

- limit:

  an `integer` defining the maximum number of results to return. If not
  informed, it defaults to the service implementation.

- gdalwarp_options:

  Options passed to `gdalwarp` through the `options` argument of
  [`sf::gdal_utils()`](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/reference/gdal_utils.html).
  The same set of options are used for all downloaded data and the final
  output images; this means that some common options (for instance,
  `PREDICTOR=3`) may cause errors if bands are of varying data types.
  The default values are provided by
  [`rsi_gdalwarp_options()`](https://docs.ropensci.org/rsi/reference/rsi_gdal_options.md).

- gdal_config_options:

  Options passed to `gdalwarp` through the `config_options` argument of
  [`sf::gdal_utils()`](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/reference/gdal_utils.html).
  The default values are provided by
  [`rsi_gdal_config_options()`](https://docs.ropensci.org/rsi/reference/rsi_gdal_options.md).

- platforms:

  The names of Landsat satellites to download imagery from. These do not
  correspond to the `platforms` column in
  [`spectral_indices()`](https://docs.ropensci.org/rsi/reference/spectral_indices.md);
  the default argument of `c("landsat-9", "landsat-8")` corresponds to
  the `Landsat-OLI` value in that column.

## Value

`output_filename`, unchanged.

## Usage Tips

It's often useful to buffer your `aoi` object slightly, on the order of
1-2 cell widths, in order to ensure that data is downloaded for your
entire AOI even after accounting for any reprojection needed to compare
your AOI to the data on the STAC server.

These functions allow for parallelizing downloads via
[`future::plan()`](https://future.futureverse.org/reference/plan.html),
and for user-controlled progress updates via
[`progressr::handlers()`](https://progressr.futureverse.org/reference/handlers.html).
If there are fewer images to download than `asset_names`, then this
function uses [`lapply()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/lapply.html) to
iterate through images and
[`future.apply::future_mapply()`](https://future.apply.futureverse.org/reference/future_mapply.html)
to iterate through downloading each asset. If there are more images than
assets, this function uses
[`future.apply::future_lapply()`](https://future.apply.futureverse.org/reference/future_lapply.html)
to iterate through images.

## Downloading from Planetary Computer

Certain data sets in Planetary Computer require [providing a
subscription
key](https://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com/docs/concepts/sas/). Even
for non-protected data sets, providing a subscription key grants you
higher rate limits and faster downloads. As such, it's a good idea to
[request a Planetary Computer
account](https://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com/account/request), then
[generate a subscription
key](https://planetarycomputer.developer.azure-api.net/). If you set the
`rsi_pc_key` environment variable to your key (either primary or
secondary; there is no difference), rsi will automatically use this key
to sign all requests against Planetary Computer.

There are currently some challenges with certain Landsat images in
Planetary Computer; please see
https://github.com/microsoft/PlanetaryComputer/discussions/101 for more
information on these images and their current status. These files may
cause data downloads to fail.

## Compositing

This function can either download all data that intersects with your
spatiotemporal AOI as multiple files (if `composite_function = NULL`),
or can be used to rescale band values, apply a mask function, and create
a composite from the resulting files in a single function call. Each of
these steps can be skipped by passing `NULL` to the corresponding
argument.

Masks are applied to each downloaded asset separately. Rescaling is
applied to the final composite after images are combined.

A number of the steps involved in creating composites – rescaling band
values, running the mask function, masking images, and compositing
images – currently rely on the `terra` package for raster calculations.
This means creating larger composites, either in geographic or temporal
dimension, may cause errors. It can be a good idea to tile your `aoi`
using
[`sf::st_make_grid()`](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/reference/st_make_grid.html)
and iterate through the tiles to avoid these errors (and to make it
easier to interrupt and restart a download job).

## Rescaling

If `rescale_bands` is `TRUE`, then this function is able to use the
`scale` and `offset` values in the `bands` field of the `raster` STAC
extension. This was implemented originally to work with the Landsat
collections in the Planetary Computer STAC catalogue, but hopefully will
work automatically with other data sources as well. Note that Sentinel-2
data typically doesn't use this STAC extension, and so the returned data
is typically not re-scaled; divide the downloaded band values by 10000
to get reflectance values in the expected values.

## Sentinel-1 Data

The `get_sentinel1_imagery()` function is designed to download
Sentinel-1 data from the Microsoft Planetary Computer STAC API. Both the
GRD and RTC Sentinel-1 collections are supported. To download RTC data,
set `collection` to `sentinel-1-rtc`, and supply your subscription key
as an environment variable named `rsi_pc_key` (through, e.g.,
[`Sys.setenv()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/Sys.setenv.html) or your
`.Renviron` file).

## AlOS PALSAR Data

The `get_alos_palsar_imagery()` function is designed to download ALOS
PALSAR annual mosaic data from the Microsoft Planetary Computer STAC
API. Data are returned as a digital number (which is appropriate for
some applications and indices). To convert to backscatter (decibels) use
the following formula: `10 * log10(dn) - 83.0` where dn is the radar
band in digital number.

## Examples

# If you're downloading data for a particularly large AOI,
# and can't composite the resulting images or want to make
# sure you can continue an interrupted download,
# consider tiling your AOI and requesting each tile separately:
aoi <- sf::st_make_grid(aoi, n = 2)
tiles <- lapply(
  seq_along(aoi),
  function(i) {
    get_landsat_imagery(
      aoi[i],
      start_date = "2022-06-01",
      end_date = "2022-08-30",
      output_filename = tempfile(fileext = ".tif")
    )
  }
)
# You'll get a list of tiles that you can then composite or
# work with however you wish:
unlist(tiles)
}
```
